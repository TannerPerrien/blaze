        <p class="lead text-muted">Are you a Phoenix local? You can pick up your Jeep the evening before your trip at no additional cost. What?! That's right. It's more fun when you're spending those vacation hours having fun rather than moving your gear around! Get packed ahead of time and wake up ready to hit the road!</p>
